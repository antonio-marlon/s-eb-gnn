 📖 [How S-EB-GNN Achieves Negative Energy](technical_note.md)

A lightweight framework for **semantic-aware resource allocation in THz/RIS-enabled 6G networks**.

## Features
- Physics-based THz channel modeling (path loss, blockage)
- Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) support
- Semantic prioritization (Critical > Video > IoT)
- Energy-based optimization with negative energy convergence
