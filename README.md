[![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/badge/sponsor-30363D?style=for-the-badge&logo=GitHub-Sponsors&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/sponsors/antonio-marlon)

A lightweight framework for **semantic-aware resource allocation in THz/RIS-enabled 6G networks**.

## Features
- Physics-based THz channel modeling (path loss, blockage)
- Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) support
- Semantic prioritization (Critical > Video > IoT)
- Energy-based optimization with negative energy convergence
