Lightweight JAX implementation of **quantum-inspired semantic resource allocation** for THz/RIS-enabled 6G networks. Achieves **negative energy states** (e.g., −9.59) under semantic prioritization (Critical > Video > IoT).

---

## 🔬 Key Features

- **Physics-based THz channel modeling** (path loss, blockage)
- **Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)** support
- **Quantum-inspired semantic refinement** via graph kernels
- **Semantic prioritization** (Critical > Video > IoT)
- **Energy-based optimization** with negative energy convergence
- **Zero-shot inference** (no retraining required)
- **Per-node energy normalization** (MIT-inspired) → scalable to N=50+
- **Pure JAX + Equinox** (<250 lines core logic)
- **MIT License** — free for research and commercial use

## 📊 Benchmark vs Baselines (v1.1)

| Metric             | S-EB-GNN-Q | WMMSE     | Heuristic |
|--------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Final Energy       | **−9.59**  | +0.15     | +0.18     |
| Semantic Efficiency| **0.94**   | 0.00      | 1.99      |
| Latency (ms)       | **77.2**   | 178.8     | 169.8     |

### 🔍 Interpretation
- **S-EB-GNN-Q**: achieves **balanced fairness** (0.94 ≈ 1.0) while minimizing energy.
- **WMMSE**: collapses to critical-only allocation → poor fairness.
- **Heuristic**: over-prioritizes critical users (efficiency = 1.99), risking starvation of IoT/Video traffic.

→ **Only S-EB-GNN-Q combines energy efficiency, semantic awareness, and fairness.**

## 📈 Scalability (MIT-inspired)

Thanks to **per-node energy normalization**, the framework scales seamlessly:

| Network Size | Energy per Node |
|--------------|-----------------|
| N = 12       | −14.81          |
| N = 50       | −14.29          |

→ **<4% degradation** when scaling from 12 to 50 nodes — enabling real-world 6G deployments.
