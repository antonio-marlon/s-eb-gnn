Lightweight JAX implementation of **quantum-inspired** semantic-aware resource allocation for THz/RIS-enabled 6G networks. Achieves negative energy states (e.g., −6.60) under semantic prioritization (Critical > Video > IoT).


- Physics-based THz channel modeling (path loss, blockage)
- Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) support
- **Quantum-inspired semantic refinement via graph kernels**
- Semantic prioritization (Critical > Video > IoT)
- Energy-based optimization with negative energy convergence
